## About us

We're a non-profit organisation based in Buenos Aires, Argentina with a mission to make politics smarter by bringing Democracy to the 21st century.

We work with all sorts of organisations, from government agencies to political parties, to small activist groups all around the world.

We've recently been through [YCombinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/) and are backed by many international philanthropic organisations like [Avina](http://www.avina.net/), [Open Society Foundations](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/), the [World Justice Project](http://worldjusticeproject.org/), among others.

We are [100% open source](https://github.com/DemocracyOS) and will always stay that way. We also have a habit of giving back to the Open Source community either by collaborating on other OSS projects, or by joining international hackathons related to Open Data initiatives, civic hacking, and the like. Our development community is large and strong, and our main repo has over 1100 stars and 350 forks, as well as available in over 19 languages.
